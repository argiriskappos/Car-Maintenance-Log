# Car Maintenance Log

A simple web app built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and EJS which allows users to track car maintenance records (oil changes, repairs, etc.).

- Create, read, update, and delete maintenance entries  
- Each record includes: service type, date, cost, location, and notes  

Color Scheme
Created using Adobe Color.
My chosen scheme uses shades of purple, gray, and dark blue to create a modern and professional aesthetic:

Primary Purple: #6C67F0
Medium Purple: #7876C4
Dark Gray: #22213D
Accent Dark Blue: #2F2E42
Secondary Gray: #77769C
Highlight Neutral: #626270
This combination provides contrast, readability, and visual estatic website across different devices.
